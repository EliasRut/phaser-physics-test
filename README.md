# Phaser Physics Test

This was set up using the amazing phaser-project-template from Yannick Deubel. You can find the
template at (https://github.com/yandeu/phaser-project-template)["https://github.com/yandeu/phaser-project-template"].

## Running it

Start out with 

```
npm install
```

to get your node_modules downloaded. Then, you can run the development server with

```
npm run start
```

or build the whole thing as a webpacked, ready to serve web app with

```
npm run build
```
